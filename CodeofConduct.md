# Code of conduct


## What is this Code of Conduct for?

Hercules is a powerful tool, but the strength of the Hercules community lies in the **people** who build, use, and support it. We’re committed to maintaining a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, appearance, body size, race, age, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof), or any other aspect of identity. We expect all members of the Hercules community to follow this Code of Conduct whenever interacting within Hercules venues (e.g., GitHub pull requests, issues, chat rooms, forums, conferences, etc.).


## Examples of Inappropriate Behavior

We come from diverse backgrounds, so assumptions about appropriate behavior may differ. Here are examples of conduct that is not aligned with the Hercules community’s values:

- Spamming, trolling, intentional disruption, or unrelated solicitation or advertisement

- Demeaning, discriminatory, or abusive language or comments

- Making negative assumptions or judgments about someone’s background, abilities, or intentions

- Harassment, stalking, or unwelcome contact, whether online or in person

- Unwanted sexual attention, explicit images, or inappropriate physical contact at in-person events

In essence: treat others with respect and kindness.

Focus conflicts productively on technical issues, think before you speak, and remember that humour in one context may be hurtful or inappropriate in our diverse, inclusive environment. Let’s create a space where everyone, regardless of background, can contribute freely.


## What Will Organizers Do About Inappropriate Behaviour?

If you engage in inappropriate behaviour, an organiser will explain why it’s inappropriate and ask you to stop. We’re not here to judge, but we ask you to respect this request so that we can keep our community safe and focused. If you disagree with what’s considered inappropriate, please raise it in a separate public or private conversation with a Hercules maintainer, rather than in a technical discussion thread.

If unacceptable behaviour continues, we may need to ban you, report you to GitHub, or take other appropriate action.


## What Should I Do If I Experience or Witness Inappropriate Behaviour?

Please reach out! Contact a community organiser as soon as possible; all reports are taken seriously and will be handled confidentially unless otherwise required by law. No concern is too small—our goal is to foster a respectful, inclusive environment for everyone.
